# Configure users

We don't provide example to configure users as we recommend using [SSO](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/administration/sso/overview/).

Another challenge for configuring users is you need to specify the password, which is not desirable.

# Configure groups

You can skip this if you have [SCIM](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/administration/scim/overview/) to
provision users and groups in an organization.
